		<h1>The Sonata-Allegro Form</h1>
		<p>The sonata form is a musical structure that consists of three main sections: Exposition, Development, and Recapitulation. It typically appears in the first movement of multi-movement pieces.</p>
		<ul>
      <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> The introduction section is optional or may be reduced to a minimum. If it is extended, it is generally slower than the main section.</li>
			<li><strong>Exposition:</strong> The primary thematic material is presented in the exposition.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>First Subject Group:</strong> This section consists of one or more themes, all in the tonic key.</li>
          <li><strong>Transition:</strong> This section is where the composer modulates from the key of the first subject to the key of the second. If the first group is in a major key, the second usually appears in the dominant key. However, if the first group is in a minor key, the second is typically the relative major.</li>
          <li><strong>Second Subject Group:</strong> This section consists of one or more themes in a different key from the first group. The second group often differs in mood from the first.</li>
          <li><strong>Closing Zone:</strong> This section is a suffix following the end of the second subject group that reinforces the new key area. The closing zone features musical material that is distinct from the second subject group and often introduces new thematic ideas.</li>
        </ul>
