		<h1>The Structure of a Piano Concerto</h1>
		<p>A piano concerto is a composition for piano accompanied by an orchestra. It usually has three movements.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>1st movement:</strong> A moderately fast movement in <a href="sonata-allegroform.html">sonata-allegro form</a>, usually including a virtuosic cadenza.</li>
			<li><strong>2nd movement:</strong> A slow movement that is more expressive and lyrical, usually in ternary form.</li>
			<li><strong>3rd movement:</strong> A faster rondo.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Examples by Mozart and Beethoven follow this model, but many others do not â€” such as Moritz Moszkowski's Piano Concerto No. 2 in E major, Op. 59, which has four movements.</p>
